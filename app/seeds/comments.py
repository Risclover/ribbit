I had a HEPA filter in every room, had to shower if I went outside, went through 2 pairs of contacts a day, etc. This was going on since I was a kid.

        I was hesitant to try the shots but decided on it since I worked across the hall from an allergy center. 6 mos into it I had no allergy symptoms and medication free. It's been 2 years now and still doing good. Stuff I didn't think about like driving with the windows down and not carrying allergy meds everywhere (oral and eye drops) has been nice.

        The schedule and cost is a huge deterrent. It was weekly for the first 6 weeks.""",
