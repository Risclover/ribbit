        I was hesitant to try the shots but decided on it since I worked across the hall from an allergy center. 6 mos into it I had no allergy symptoms and medication free. It's been 2 years now and still doing good. Stuff I didn't think about like driving with the windows down and not carrying allergy meds everywhere (oral and eye drops) has been nice.

GitHub have a system where they will search through every bit of public code uploaded, then they have patten detection to find api keys/security tokens and they can match them to say Google, Slack, AWS, in your case OpenAI. Then github will send the found keys to the relevant organization through a batch process, then the organization will see if its real, disable it and let the customer know they stuffed up.

They build the system with Slack I think, to stop slack having to scrape GitHub constantly looking for leaked API keys in public code.""",
