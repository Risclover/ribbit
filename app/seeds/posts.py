        title="YSK Overdosing on Tylenol (Acetaminophen/Paracetamol/Panadol) is a slow, painful way to die",
        content='''Why YSK: Due to being cheap, readily available, and easily accessible, Tylenol overdose has become one of the most common suicide methods. However, people don‚Äôt realize how truly awful a Tylenol overdose really is.

        The first 0-24 hours you may feel nothing, or mild symptoms. After that, the torture begins. You will suffer profuse vomiting, edema (your body swells up), a crushing headache, turn yellow, and feel like your liver and kidneys are being stabbed nonstop, what people often describe as the worst pain they‚Äôve ever experienced, and bleeding. This goes on for days or even weeks. Meanwhile, if you reach the final stage, you are suffering as you wait for a liver transplant or death (when your organs shut down).

        Most people survive Tylenol overdoses; however, they are often left with permanent liver/kidney damage, which can require things such as dialysis for multiple hours several times per week, medication, and lifestyle changes.

        What can be done? 3 things:

        Educate people on the reality of an OD.

        Mandate that Tylenol be sold in blister-pack form. When the UK implemented this, intentional overdoses declined by 43 percent!

        Treat the underlying problem. We have a mental health crisis, and it‚Äôs not going to go away on its own. Developed countries especially need to work on providing resources to people with mental health conditions, before it escalates to suicide.

However, they've made CS50, Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science and Programming, available online for free. And upon completion, you even get a free certificate from Harvard.

I can't overstate how good the course is. The professor is super engaging. The lectures are recorded annually, so the curriculum is always up to date. And it's very interactive, with weekly assignments that you complete through an in-browser code editor.

To top it all off, once you complete the course, you get a free certificate of completion from Harvard. Very few online courses offer free certificates nowadays, especially from top universities.

You can take the course for free on Harvard OpenCourseWare:

https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/

(Note that you can also take it through edX, but there, the certificate costs $150. On Harvard OpenCourseWare, the course is exactly the same, but the certificate is entirely free.)

        title="YSK if you have a minimum wage job, the employer cannot deduct money from checks for uniforms, missing cash, stolen meals, wrong deliveries, damaged products, etc. You absolutely have to get paid a minimum wage.",
        content="""Why YSK: It's extremely common for employers to deduct losses from employee's checks if they believe the employee had some responsibility for that loss. In some states this is illegal as well, but overall the employer cannot do this if it means you will earn less than minimum wage.

Some states enacted laws that force employers to pay out triple damages for violations of several wage laws. Most states will fine the company $1000.
