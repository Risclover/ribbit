-- Sanity checks for common errors in making system tables that don't fit
-- comfortably into either opr_sanity or type_sanity.

-- Every test failure in this file should be closely inspected.
-- The description of the failing test should be read carefully before
-- adjusting the expected output.  In most cases, the queries should
-- not find *any* matching entries.
--
-- NB: run this test early, because some later tests create bogus entries.
-- **************** pg_depend ****************
-- Look for illegal values in pg_depend fields.
-- classid/objid can be zero, but only in 'p' entries

-- is pinned.  If not, and if that OID was generated during initdb, then
-- perhaps initdb forgot to scan that catalog for pinnable entries.
-- Generally, it's okay for a catalog to be listed in the output of this
-- test if that catalog is scanned by initdb.c's setup_depend() function;
-- whatever OID the test is complaining about must have been added later
-- in initdb, where it intentionally isn't pinned.  Legitimate exceptions
-- to that rule are listed in the comments in setup_depend().
